Used Z3 to compute all solutions for all days for the [Palmetto Whole Year Puzzle](https://www.palmettopuzzleworks.net/product-page/the-whole-year-puzzle), because I was curious as to if certain days were harder / had fewer solutions. 

Check out my [blog post](https://jcrowell.net) for explaination or the [notebook](https://github.com/jcrowe6/whole-year-puzzle-z3/blob/master/yearsat.ipynb) itself.
